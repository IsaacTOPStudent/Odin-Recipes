<h2> Description</h2>
<h4>The hamburger is one of the most famous meals of all. And with fair reason is a meal that satisfies. <p>It is a meal that contains many ingredients and can be prepared in many ways.</p></h4>
<h2> Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li><h4>500g of ground beef</h4></li>
<li><h4>4 hamburger buns</h4></li>
<li><h4>8 strips of bacon</h4></li>
<li><h4>4 slices of cheddar cheese (optional)</h4></li>
<li><h4>Lettuce leaves</h4></li>
<li><h4>Tomato slices</h4></li>
<li><h4>Red onion slices (optional)</h4></li>
<li><h4>Sauce of your choice</h4></li>
<li><h4>salt or pepper or both</h4></li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation steps</h2>
<ol>
<li><h4>Preheat your grill or skillet over medium-high heat.</h4></li>
<li><h4>Form four hamburger patties with the ground beef, ensuring they are evenly thick so they cook evenly.</h4></li>
<li><h4>Cook the hamburger patties on the grill or skillet for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they are cooked to your liking. <p>If you choose to add cheddar cheese, place a slice on each patty a few minutes before removing them from the heat, allowing it to melt.</p></h4></li>
<li><h4>While the hamburgers are cooking, fry the bacon strips in a separate skillet until crispy.</h4></li>
<li><h4>Once the hamburgers are done, remove them from the heat and let them rest for a few minutes.</h4></li>
<li><h4>Meanwhile, lightly toast the hamburger buns on the grill or skillet</h4></li>
<li><h4>To assemble the burger, place a hamburger patty on the bottom half of each bun, then add the bacon, <p>lettuce leaves, tomato slices, and onion slices, and finally the sauce of your choice. Top with the other half of the bun.</p></h4></li>
<li><h4>ENJOY</h4></li>
